1 Call me Ishmael.  Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--
2 having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular
3 to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little
4 and see the watery part of the world.  It is a way I have
5 of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
6 Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth;
7 whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I
8 find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses,
9 and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet;
10 and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me,
11 that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from
12 deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
13 people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea
14 as soon as I can.  This is my substitute for pistol and ball.
15 With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword;
16 I quietly take to the ship.  There is nothing surprising in this.
17 If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time
18 or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards
19 the ocean with me.

21 There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves
22 as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce surrounds it with her surf.
23 Right and left, the streets take you waterward.  Its extreme downtown
24 is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled
25 by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land.
26 Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
